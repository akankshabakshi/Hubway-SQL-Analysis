# Our Analysis

Here are some questions that we'll try to answer over the course of this post: 
1. What was the duration of the longest trip?
2. How many trips were taken by registered users?
3. What was the average trip duration?
4. Do registered or casual users take longer trips? 
5. What is the average duration of trips by users over the age of 30? 

# Next Steps

How many trips incurred additional fees (lasted longer than 30 minutes)?
Which bike was used for the longest total time?
Did registered or casual users take more round trips?
Which municipality had the longest average duration?
